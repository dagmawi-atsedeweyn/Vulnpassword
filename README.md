# Vulnpassword
Check if your password can be dictionary attacked. 
The program is written using python as part of my school project. The program compares users password with a dictionary list(rockyou.txt) and tells you if your password is in the list.

The program also gives you the option to create a new password that's not in the dictionary based on a common word you know.
